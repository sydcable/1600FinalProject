# What Are Vector Images?

Vector images are digital graphics made using mathmatical formulas that define the lines, points, and curves of the image. This means that the images are not created using pixles. This means that vector graphics are resolution-independent, allowing them to scale up or down without losing quality.

## Characteristics

- **Scalable**: Vector images can be resized infinitely without becoming blurry or pixelated.
- **Smaller file sizes**: Because they store mathematical instructions instead of pixel data, vector files are usually smaller than high-resolution bitmap files.
- **Editable**: Individual elements (shapes, colors, lines) can be easily modified without affecting the entire image.

## Advantages 

- Perfect for logos, icons, and illustrations that need to be resized for different purposes.
- Maintains crisp edges and clarity at any size.
- Easier to edit and customize compared to bitmap images.

## Disadvantages

- Not suitable for complex, detailed images like photographs because they cannot represent subtle color gradients well.
- Requires specialized software (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape) to create and edit.

## Common Use Cases

- Company logos and branding materials
- Icons and user interface elements
- Illustrations and infographics
- Print designs that require scaling (posters, banners)
