# What are Bitmap Images?

Bitmap images, also known as raster images, are made up of a grid of tiny squares called pixels. Each pixel represents a single point of color in the image. When combined, these pixels form the complete picture you see on your screen.

## Characteristics

- **Resolution-dependent**: Bitmap images have a fixed number of pixels. If you enlarge the image beyond its original resolution, it becomes blurry or pixelated.
- **File size**: The size of a bitmap image depends on its resolution and color depth. Higher resolution and more colors mean larger file sizes.
- **Color detail**: Bitmap images can display rich color gradients and complex details, making them ideal for photographs.

## Advantages

- Excellent for realistic images like photos because they can capture subtle color variations.
- Widely supported across most devices and applications.

## Disadvantages

- Not scalable: Enlarging a bitmap image reduces its quality.
- Large file sizes: High-resolution images can take up significant storage space.
- Editing individual elements is difficult because the image is pixel-based rather than object-based.

## Common Use Cases

- Digital photography
- Web graphics (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- Detailed artwork where color gradients are important
