# Bitmap vs Vector: Key Differences

|Feature | Bitmap Images | Vector Images |
|------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|Composition | Made of pixels (tiny squares of color) | Made of mathematical paths and shapes |
|Scalability | Loses quality when resized (pixelates) | Scales infinitely without losing quality |
|File Size | Larger for high-resolution images | Generally smaller and more efficient |
|Detail & Color | Excellent for complex color gradients (photos) | Limited for detailed color shading|
|Editing | Hard to edit individual elements | Easy to edit shapes and components  |
|Best For | Photographs, detailed artwork | Logos, icons, illustrations, print designs|
|Common Formats | JPEG, PNG, GIF | SVG, EPS, PDF|

## When to use Bitmap vs. Vector:

Choosing between bitmap and vector images depends on the type of project and the desired outcome. Here are some practical guidelines:

## Use Bitmap Images When:

- You need realistic, detailed visuals, such as photographs or complex artwork.
- The image will be displayed at a fixed size, like on a website or in a digital presentation.
- You require rich color gradients and textures that vectors cannot easily replicate.

### Common scenarios:

- Photo editing and retouching
- Digital paintings

## Use Vector Images When:

- You need graphics that will be resized frequently without losing quality (e.g., logos).
- The design consists of simple shapes, lines, and text rather than detailed color shading.
- You want smaller file sizes for scalable graphics.

### Common scenarios:

- Branding materials (logos, icons)
- Print designs (posters, banners)
- Infographics and illustrations
